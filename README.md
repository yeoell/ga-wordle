# GA Wordle project

General Assembly wordle project

I'm a student at General Assembly, studying software engineering. For my first project, I am creating a clone of the game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), drawing on what I have learnt during our first unit: front-end development. The game is built using HTML, CSS and javascript.

_Wordle_ is a game where players have to guess a word. For each letter they input, they will be told if the letter is correct and in the right place, correct but in the wrong place. or not present in the word. Cells are shaded green, yellow and grey to reflect this.

### My clone

My clone works by using this same principle. A word is generated at the beginning of each round that the player needs to guess. They can use an input box to make their guess and on using the 'GO' button, it will be evaluated against the generated word. Like the original game, the box the letter outputs to will either appear as green, yellow or grey depending on whether they are correct, correct but in the wrong place, or incorrect. As a point of difference to the original, I added a timer that will count down, and once it reaches zero, an alert will display that tells you that you ran out of time and what the correct word was.

You can view and play the game [here](https://yeoell.github.io/ga-wordle/) or at this link: <https://yeoell.github.io/ga-wordle/>.
