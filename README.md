# GA Wordle project

General Assembly wordle project

I'm a student at General Assembly, studying software engineering. For my first project, I am creating a clone of the game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), drawing on what I have learnt during our first unit: front-end development. The game is built using HTML, CSS and javascript.

_Wordle_ is a game where players have to guess a word. For each letter they input, they will be told if the letter is correct and in the right place, correct but in the wrong place. or not present in the word. Cells are shaded green, yellow and grey to reflect this.

You can view and play the game [here](https://yeoell.github.io/ga-wordle/) or at this link: (https://yeoell.github.io/ga-wordle/).
